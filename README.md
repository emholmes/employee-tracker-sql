This application uses node.js and mysql to perform CRUD operations on the sql database. Since this application will not be deployed, the video walkthrough below demonstrates the apps functionality.

## Installation
To install any necessary dependencies run the following command: 

    npm install

## Usage 
After cloning the repo to your local machine, open the package in an IDE. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed (hint: `node -v` & `npm -v`). In the package root directory, install the following packages: inquirer.js, mysql2, and console.table (`npm i inquirer mysql2 console.table`). Once all dependencies are installed, initiate the program by running `npm start` from the terminal in the root directory. The user will be prompted with a list of questions that will utilize sql queries to either create, read, update, or delete information on the database. Select "Quit" to exit the application.
